If your computer has 4 GB of RAM, not all of it is available for your use. Some of the RAM is reserved for system processes, the operating system, and hardware components (e.g., integrated graphics). The exact amount available to you will depend on your system configuration. For example, if your system uses integrated graphics, a portion of the RAM will be dedicated to that, leaving you with less usable RAM for applications. Typically, you might have around 3 to 3.5 GB of usable RAM in such a setup.
